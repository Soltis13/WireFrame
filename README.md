    smaller than or equal to 768 px (smartphones)   
    larger than 768 px (small devices, tablets)   
    larger than 992 px (medium devices)   
    larger than 1200px (large devices)   


  Current desktop screen resolutions in use (worldwide)   

  This table can be your guideline for your mediaqueries.   
  Screen width 	Smallest screen height 	In use worldwide   
  1024 px 	768 px 	3%   
  1280 px 	800 px 	11%   
  1360 px 	768 px 	2%   
  1366 px 	768 px 	35%
